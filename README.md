# Introduction

Over the financial year of 2013-2104, investors seeks to know how well the manufacturers in the Stationery Industry are fairing to help guide thier decision on which of the manufacturer/ segment should they invest through and if thier investment will be worth of it.

# Problem Statement

1. Calculate the following, using either Excel or DAX functions:
a. Gross Sales
b. Discount (use the discount rate)
c. Revenue
d. Profit before Tax
e. Profit Margin
f. Tax on Profit (tax rate 5%)
g. Profit after Tax
2. Create a report overview for:
a. Segment
b. State
c. Product
3. Produce a report on all products sold between January and December 2014, showing number of sales, sales proportions and financial performance. Ensure your analysis can be used to determine whether there is growth or decline on any of the product lines.
4. What key products are the drivers of performance?
5. If we would like to discontinue any product sub due to poor outcomes, what would this be?
6. What product do we pay the highest tax on?

# Skills I demonstrated

# Analysis

Listed below are some of the Dax formular and calculated columns I wrote.

Gross Sales = [Units Sold]*[Sale Price]

Discount rate=if([DiscountBand]="None",0,if([DiscountBand]="Low",0.01,if([DiscountBand]="Medium",0.05,0.1)))

Discount = [Discount Rate]*[Gross Sales]

Revenue = [Gross Sales]-[Discount]

Manufacture Cost = [Units Sold]*[Manufacturing Price]

Profit before Tax = [Revenue] - [Manufacture Cost]

Tax on profit = 0.05*[Profit before Tax]

Profit after tax = [Profit before Tax]-[Tax on profit]

Month_number = MONTH(financials3[Date])

Year = YEAR(financials3[Date])

Month = FORMAT(financials3[Date],"MMM")

# Story Telling
![](slide_1.PNG)
Good day all, Ahmed and I will be presenting to your our report from the analysis Office supply dataset titled: "DESCRIPTIVE & DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS OF A STATIONERY INDUSTRY FOR YEAR 2014".
![](slide_2.PNG)
* Investors seeks to understand the perfomance of Stationery Industry over the year 2013-2014. This insight will help them to access if their investment has impressive return or not and if they need to backoff or project for the next fiscal year. 
* These insights they sought for includes: determine sales proportions and financial performance for the present fiscal year by comparing selling Price against production (cost) price, trend of profit, production cost, revenue generated by Discount over the product and across all the segment (segment).
![](slide_3.PNG)
* Across, the stationery industry for the Fiscal year 2014; Sales were very poor, trend of profit is erratic with huge loss recorded in June and August and Maximum profit of 3.1M
* Manufacturing cost eat deeply into the Revenue which then led the industry to record 12.70% profit margin.
* These performance were done by 6 segments, across 6 location with 5 products (stapler, notepad, biro, A4 paper and Biro).
* The average sales price was the same across the state, but manufacrturing cost less in Lagos and cost most in Oyo.
![](slide_4.PNG)
* Small Business had outstanding performace, with just 15.58% of the total manufacture cost in the industry in 2014, had an impressive profit margin
* Government followed, with all the resources at her disposal to manufacture while Mid Market and Channel Partners performed woefuly: as their average manuafacturing price consumed the sales profit leading to poor profit margin.
* The investors should invest through Small Business and Government.
![](slide_7.PNG)
This slide looks indepth at every product performance across all segment, the product  to discontinue are staples, notepad and Markers; while A4 paper, Biro and pencil can be continued.
![](slide_5.PNG)
* Across all the states, the segments kept their perfomence the same as shown in the previous slide: Small Business kept the  outstanding performace, total manufacture in the industry turned it to great profit margin,
* Followed by government who has all the resources at her disposal to manufacture while Mid Market and Channel Partners performed woefuly: as their average manuafacturing price consumed the sales profit leading to poor profit margin.
![](product_state.PNG)
* Across all state, more resources were commited to the production of products to be discontinue (stapler, markers, notepad).
* Fewer resources were commited to A4 paper, Biro and pencil: these are the product that had impressive performance. 
![](slide_6.PNG)
The product with fewer/greater manufacture yeild great/lesser profit margin because the average sales price is greater than the average manufacture (cost) profit. Revenue is driven by discount.
# Key Findings

* Sales is as a result of discount.
* Good/bad  performance of product depend on either sales price is greater than manufacture price of the price and vice versa
* Product such as Staplers, Marker and Notepad should not be manufactured again.

# Recommendation

* Government and Enterprise segment should undertaken measures to minimize Manufacture cost by sources of its raw materials from a cheaper source.
* The Discount Bands: High and Medium should be erased by all segment to mitigate the detriment cost it have on the companyâ€™s profit.
* All segment should come up with measure to retain its customer by introducing subscription plan.
* Product such as Staplers and Notepad should not be manufactured again.

# Conclusion
Clearly, every segment can achieve greater profitability if and only if they minimize their manufacture cost and adopt to continue Low discount band.
